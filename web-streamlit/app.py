    Hello and welcome you are on Getaroundand : 
             
    for more information read the following:    
            
    When our users rent a car, they are required to go through a check-in process at the start of the rental and a check-out process at the end to:

      * Evaluate the car's condition and inform relevant parties of any existing or rental-incurred damages.
      * Mileage traveled during car rental.       
      * Check and compare fuel levels.
    
    The check-in and check-out processes for our rentals can be completed through three separate workflows:

      * Mobile rental agreement facilitated through a mobile apps, the driver and owner meet, and both parties sign the rental agreement using the owner's smartphone.
      * Connect option, the driver doesn't meet the owner and unlocks the car using their smartphone.
      * Traditional paper contract " Not available at the moment".
